# openplc-tools
tools to use with https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3

tested on python 3.10 running on linux and a raspberry pi 4

## download.py

automates the process of manually having to go to the webserver (using mine on a raspberry pi) and uploading the file. It will do the compile but will not start it (yet) - that should be pretty easy to add I think

uses two non-standard dependencies:

`pip install lxml`

`pip install loguru`
